# Group of common builders used when pushing and pulling build artefacts to

# upload-s3-binaries is responsible for uploading a binaries tarball after a

# for each platforms in platforms.
# Expected parameters:
#   platforms: space separated list of go style platforms
# Expected pre-requisites:
# - make-juju has been called for the same platforms as this command.
